#Short cuts for command line:

- Ctrl + r: search in history
- Ctrl + a: go to beginning of current line
- Ctrl + e: go to end of current line
- Ctrl + f: forward by character
- Ctrl + b: backward by character
- Ctrl + l: clear screen
- Ctrl + k: delete rest of the line, (from current cursor to the end of line)
- Ctrl + u: delete current line

#Short cuts for iPython:

- %cd dir: change directory within iPython
- %pwd: check the path of current working directory
- %dirs: show all directories
- %dhist: show all directories from history
- %env: show environment
- %pdb: turn ON debugger
- how to avoid exiting and re-entering iPython every time I edit `.py` script?
```
import some_lib
reload(some_lib)
```
